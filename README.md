# Intelligent_Cam_System
Project of an intelligent vision system for operation in difficult weather conditions, which I am currently developing.

# Objective of the work:
The aim of the work is to create an intelligent vision system to work in difficult weather conditions. The system is to effectively detect installed objects and their movement, then inform the user about it, while being resistant to potential rainfall and temperature changes.

# Job description:
The work involves preparing a 360-degree motion module, mounting it on the camera housing, and effectively isolating it with wireless inductive power supply. Equipping the housing with an additional subsystem of a humidity sensor working with the radiator, which will prevent evaporation inside the housing by calculating the dew point, as well as a subsystem with a rainfall sensor and a servo that will control the operation of the wiper. Additionally, a communication module between the camera and the computer system and a video data analysis system will be prepared.

As part of this work, I assume preparation of:
• 360-degree motion module, based on two servomechanisms with mounting on
  housing for the camera and the ability to control it manually or directly from the camera.
• Effectively insulated camera housing with wireless inductive power supply.
• Housing equipment with:
  - additional subsystem of a humidity sensor cooperating with the radiator. By
    dew point calculation, the subsystem will prevent evaporation inside the housing,
  - subsystem with a rainfall sensor and a servo that will control the operation
    wipers,
  - communication module between the camera and the computer system with the possibility of collecting
    live image.
  - and a communication module between the camera and the motion module control system.
• Video data analysis system with motion detection.

The project is still under construction, currently I am adapting the opencv library for face detection.
